JekyllCMS is a content editor for GitHub Pages. It's the missing link for
non-programmers to use Jekyll: a friendly backend.

## Getting started
In the spirit of [GitHub Pages][gh-pages], you don't need to host anything
yourself, but you do need to configure a few things.

1. First you need [a GitHub account][join]. Don't forget to [verify your email
   address][verify], otherwise GitHub won't update your public website.

2. [Create][create] a repository for your website.

3. Go to [jekyllcms.grep.ro]() and authorize your GitHub account. You should
   then see a list of your repositories, including the new site. Click on it
   and start editing!
