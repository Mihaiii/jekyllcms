JekyllCMS is a content editor for GitHub Pages. It's the missing link for
non-programmers to use Jekyll: a friendly backend.

## Getting started
In the spirit of GitHub Pages, you don't need to host anything yourself, but
you do need to configure a few things.

### GitHub account
First you need [a GitHub account][join]. Don't forget to [verify your email
address][verify], otherwise GitHub won't update your public website.

[join]: https://github.com/join
[verify]: https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-email-address/

### Repository
Set up a repository for your website:

1. [Create][create] a new repository.
2. Sorry, this step is still work-in-progress! For now, create a new `gh-pages`
   branch, with a `_config.yml` file like so:

        title: My new Jekyll website

[create]: https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/

### Edit the content
Go to [jekyllcms.grep.ro]() and authorize your GitHub account. You should then
see a list of your repositories, including the new site. Click on it, create
a page, and start editing!
